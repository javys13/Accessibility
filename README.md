# Horiseon Accessibility Challenge

## Description
In this project I fixed a couple of issues with the code. One of the links in the header menu was not properly working. I restructured the code in the index.html file to better meet the accessibility standards. I also consolidated many of the class files in both the html and css files. Below you can find the link to deployed application.
Also, is a quick glimpse in the screenshot of both the deployed page and the css code.
